# mterm — Cross-Platform GUI Terminal (PySide6 + xterm.js)

## Overview
A desktop terminal application (Windows + Linux) built with PySide6, rendering
terminals via embedded xterm.js (in `QWebEngineView`), backed by real PTYs.
Supports multiple tabs, a customizable sidebar of one-click command buttons,
and a Macros menu for multi-step/multi-tab command sequences.

## Core Architecture Decisions

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Terminal rendering | xterm.js + addon-fit + addon-webgl, vendored locally in `assets/xterm/` (no CDN, offline-capable) |
| Python <-> JS bridge | `QWebChannel` (no extra port/server) |
| PTY backend | `pywinpty` (ConPTY) on Windows, `ptyprocess` (openpty) on Linux, behind a common `PtySession` wrapper interface |
| Project tooling | `uv` (installed via `pipx install uv`), `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` |
| Packaging (later) | PyInstaller, one spec per OS |

## Data Model — unified "Command Preset"

Commands and macros are the same underlying object, viewed two ways:

```yaml
Preset:
  name: str
  group: str                       # optional, for menu/sidebar section organization
  lines: list[str]                 # one or more shell lines
  target: active | new_tab         # default: active if len(lines)==1 else new_tab
  show_in_sidebar: bool            # opt-in to sidebar button
```

Stored as a single JSON/YAML file (e.g. `~/.config/mterm/presets.json` on Linux,
`%APPDATA%/mterm/presets.json` on Windows).

- **Commands sidebar**: shows presets with `show_in_sidebar: true`. One-click
  sends `lines` to the currently active terminal tab. Fast, always visible.
- **Macros menu** (dropdown, grouped by `group`): full preset list, with
  Run / Edit / New / Delete. Presets with `target: new_tab` open a fresh tab,
  spawn a PTY, and feed `lines` into it in sequence.

### Sidebar Layout (separate from preset content)

Layout is a distinct, user-editable arrangement on top of the preset list —
editing *placement/appearance*, not the command itself:

```yaml
SidebarLayout:
  sections:
    - title: str
      columns: int                 # buttons per row
      button_size: small|medium|large
      preset_refs: list[str]       # ordered preset names in this section
```

Edited via an "Edit Layout" mode on the sidebar (drag to reorder/add/remove),
stored separately from `presets.json` (e.g. `sidebar_layout.json`) so layout
and content can evolve independently.

## Phased Build Plan

### Phase 1 — Single-tab terminal ✅ done
Goal: prove the core rendering + I/O loop works cross-platform before any
tabs/macros/sidebar complexity.

- [x] `uv init` project, add deps: `PySide6`, `PySide6-Addons` (WebEngine), `pywinpty` (win only), `ptyprocess` (posix only)
- [x] Vendor xterm.js + addon-fit into `assets/xterm/`
- [x] `PtySession` abstract wrapper: `start(shell, cols, rows)`, `write(data)`, `resize(cols, rows)`, `on_output` callback, `close()`, `is_alive`
  - `WinPtySession` using `pywinpty`
  - `PosixPtySession` using `ptyprocess` (implemented, not yet verified on Linux)
- [x] `TerminalWidget(QWidget)`: hosts `QWebEngineView` loading local `terminal.html`, wires `QWebChannel` object (`TerminalBridge`) exposing `sendInput`/`resize`/`ready`/`setTitle` (JS->Py) and `output`/`exited`/`title_changed` (Py->JS)
- [x] `terminal.html`/`terminal.js`: init xterm.js + fit addon, pipe keystrokes to bridge, render incoming PTY output, handle resize -> notify bridge
- [x] `MainWindow(QMainWindow)`: hosts terminal(s), spawns default shell (`$SHELL` on Linux, `powershell.exe` on Windows) on startup
- [x] Verify: shell prompt renders, keyboard I/O works, resizing the window resizes the PTY, full-screen apps (vim) render correctly, process exit closes cleanly (caught + fixed a PTY-leak-on-close bug: child widgets never get `closeEvent` from a closing `QMainWindow`)
- [x] pytest + pytest-qt suite: PTY backend (real spawn/write/read/resize), bridge signal re-emission, widget wiring against a fake PtySession

**Definition of done for Phase 1**: one window, one working real terminal, on both Windows and Linux, no crashes on resize/exit. *(Windows verified end-to-end; Linux backend implemented but untested — no Linux machine available yet.)*

### Phase 2 — Tabs ✅ done
- [x] `TerminalTabWidget(QTabWidget)` central widget, each tab = one `TerminalWidget` + `PtySession`
- [x] New tab (`+` corner button, Ctrl+Shift+T), close tab (per-tab "x", Ctrl+Shift+W), Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab to switch — deliberately not plain Ctrl+T/W, which would fight bash/readline's Ctrl+W word-delete
- [x] Tab labels: tmux-style `"{index}:{title}"`, live-updated from the shell's OSC title sequence (`xterm.js onTitleChange` -> bridge), renumbered on add/close/reorder
- [x] `active_terminal()` tracks the current tab's `TerminalWidget` for later command/macro targeting
- [x] Closing the last tab closes the window; closing the window (titlebar X) shuts down every tab's PTY, not just the active one
- [x] pytest-qt suite: tab creation/labeling/renumbering, active-terminal tracking, all-tabs-closed vs close-all-tabs semantics, next/prev wraparound

### Phase 3 — Command Presets + Sidebar ✅ done
- [x] `Preset` dataclass + `PresetStore` JSON persistence (`presets.json` under the
      platformdirs user config dir), seeded with example presets on first run
- [x] `CommandSidebar` dock widget: buttons grouped by `group` (ungrouped flat at
      top), single column — full drag-and-drop `SidebarLayout` arrangement deferred
      to Phase 4, per-scope decision (not enough presets/macros yet to need it)
- [x] Click -> `run_in_active()` sends `lines` + Enter to the active terminal's PTY,
      always active regardless of a preset's `target` (sidebar = one-click-now,
      `target` only matters once the Phase 4 Macros menu can open new tabs)
- [x] `PresetEditorDialog` (add/edit/delete, set group + show_in_sidebar)
- [x] pytest suite: PresetStore CRUD/persistence, sidebar grouping/click emission,
      editor dialog New/Save/Delete flows

### Phase 4 — Macros menu + new-tab execution
- Macros menu (grouped dropdown) listing all presets
- `target: new_tab` execution: open tab, spawn PTY, feed lines sequentially
- Sidebar "Edit Layout" mode (drag reorder, section management)

### Phase 5 — Packaging & polish
- PyInstaller specs (Windows `.exe`, Linux binary/AppImage)
- App icon, settings persistence (last window size, default shell), themes (xterm.js theme presets)

## Open Questions / Deferred
- Multi-step macro *scripting* (delays, wait-for-pattern) — deferred past v1 per earlier decision; current model only supports "send lines in sequence" with no conditional waiting.
- Session persistence across app restarts (reopen tabs) — not yet decided.
- Config file format: JSON assumed above; can switch to YAML/TOML if preferred.
